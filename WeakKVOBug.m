In Objective-C, a tricky error can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and the object's lifecycle, particularly when dealing with weak references.  If an observer is registered with a weak reference to the observed object, and the observed object is deallocated before the observer removes itself, a crash can occur when the observer attempts to access the deallocated object. This often manifests as an EXC_BAD_ACCESS error.
